- `app/api/test-http-db/route.js` - HTTP DB test endpoint

## Migration Process

For each endpoint:

1. **Replace imports**:

   ```js
   // FROM:
   import { query, transaction } from '@/lib/db-http-cloudflare';

   // TO:
   import { SupabaseClient } from '../../../lib/db-supabase.js';
   const db = new SupabaseClient();
   ```

2. **Update authentication**:

   ```js
   // Add authOptions import for getServerSession
   import { authOptions } from '../../auth/[...nextauth]/route.js';
   const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
   ```

3. **Convert SQL queries** to Supabase client methods
4. **Update error handling** to use NextResponse
5. **Test functionality** after migration
