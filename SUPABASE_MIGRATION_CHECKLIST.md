## ðŸ§ª **TEST/DEBUG ENDPOINTS - No migration needed (3 endpoints)**

These can remain as-is or be removed:

- `app/api/debug-http/route.js` - Debug endpoint
- `app/api/test-edge/route.js` - Edge test endpoint
- `app/api/test-http-db/route.js` - HTTP DB test endpoint

---

## Migration Process

For each endpoint:

1. **Replace imports**:

   ```js
   // FROM:
   import { query, transaction } from '@/lib/db-http-cloudflare';

   // TO:
   import { SupabaseClient } from '../../../lib/db-supabase.js';
   const db = new SupabaseClient();
   ```

2. **Update authentication**:

   ```js
   // Add authOptions import for getServerSession
   import { authOptions } from '../../auth/[...nextauth]/route.js';
   const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
   ```

3. **Convert SQL queries** to Supabase client methods
4. **Update error handling** to use NextResponse
5. **Test functionality** after migration

---

## Current Issues

- **JWT Session Errors**: Routes using old client can't authenticate properly
- **Database Connection Failures**: HTTP client no longer connects to Supabase
- **Settings Page Issues**: Organization invitations not working due to unmigrated route

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with **HIGH PRIORITY** endpoints to fix immediate user issues
2. Focus on `organizations/[id]/invitations` first (blocking settings page)
3. Migrate incident and service management endpoints
4. Test each migration thoroughly before moving to next endpoint
5. Update any missing Supabase client methods as needed
