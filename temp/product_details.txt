Project Requirements Document – Next.js SaaS Application
Overview and Tech Stack
This project will be a full-stack SaaS web application built with Next.js (React framework) and a PostgreSQL database. The app will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages, leveraging Cloudflare’s global edge network for fast content delivery and server-side rendering (SSR). We have chosen Next.js for its robust SSR capabilities and React ecosystem, and Postgres for a reliable relational data store. Cloudflare Pages now supports running Next.js in an edge runtime, meaning our application code runs on Cloudflare Workers at the edge

. Key technologies include:
Next.js 13+ for the frontend and backend API routes, enabling SSR and a rich React UI. (We’ll use the latest Next.js features like the App Router if possible for improved routing and server components).
PostgreSQL as the primary database for persistence. We will likely use an ORM (e.g. Prisma or Drizzle) to interact with Postgres. Cloudflare’s environment does not support native Node.js sockets by default, but it now allows direct TCP connections to databases, so we can connect to Postgres via a serverless driver or ORM that’s Cloudflare-compatible

. For instance, Drizzle ORM has documentation for usage with Cloudflare Workers, and Neon’s serverless Postgres driver can work over WebSocket from Cloudflare
neon.com
.
Cloudflare Pages Hosting: The app will be deployed on Cloudflare Pages, using Pages Functions for server-side code. This gives us a globally distributed app that runs close to end-users. We must ensure our code and dependencies are compatible with Cloudflare’s edge runtime, which has some limitations (for example, certain Node modules like fs or native binaries aren’t supported)
reddit.com
. Cloudflare’s 2024 updates have improved compatibility with many NPM packages, but the dev team should be prepared to polyfill or adjust any libraries that don’t work on the edge

.
SendGrid for sending transactional emails (e.g. verification emails, invites, notifications). SendGrid is a popular email delivery platform that allows sending all kinds of emails reliably
medium.com
. We’ll use its API (via the official Node/JS library @sendgrid/mail) to send emails from within our Next.js API routes or server actions.
Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Users will log in via their Google accounts (Single Sign-On). We plan to integrate NextAuth.js (recently rebranded to Auth.js) to handle OAuth with Google for a smooth sign-in experience. NextAuth provides a battle-tested, easy way to manage providers like Google in Next.js apps
telerik.com
. This will offload a lot of auth complexity (token handling, session management) and ensure a secure login flow.
Component Library/UI Kit: We will adopt a modern React component library to accelerate UI development and ensure a polished, consistent look. After evaluating options (MUI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Shadcn/Radix, etc.), Material UI (MUI) is a strong choice. MUI is one of the most popular React UI libraries, offering a comprehensive set of customizable components that follow Material Design guidelines
blog.croct.com
. Its theming system will allow us to implement custom branding easily. (Alternatively, Chakra UI is another option known for flexibility and accessible components
blog.croct.com
, but MUI’s extensive component catalog and industry adoption make it a favorable pick for a “modern and polished” UI.) The chosen library will give us pre-built form inputs, navigation elements, modals, tables, etc., all styled consistently so the app looks professional out-of-the-box.
Development Notes: The dev team should set up environment variables for sensitive configs (Postgres connection string, SendGrid API key, Google OAuth client ID/secret, etc.). Cloudflare Pages allows configuring these securely in the deployment settings. We will also use a version control workflow (Git) and likely a CI/CD pipeline (Cloudflare Pages integrates with GitHub) for deployments.
Key Features and Requirements
1. Organization Management (Multi-Tenant Support)
Our application will support organizations (orgs) with multiple team members. This implies a multi-tenant architecture: each organization is a tenant with its own data, and users can belong to one or multiple organizations. Key requirements:
Organization Model: In the database, we will have an Organizations table and a join table (or user roles table) mapping users to organizations. A user account can be associated with one or many orgs. Each org will have attributes like name, and settings including branding details (logo, custom domain – see Custom Branding section).
Team Roles & Permissions: Within an org, members can have roles (e.g. Owner/Admin, Member). Admins can manage org settings, invite users, and view billing, whereas regular members might have restricted access. We will implement basic role-based access control so that certain actions (like modifying billing, inviting new users, customizing branding) are limited to org admins. The front-end should respect these permissions – e.g., hide or disable admin-only UI elements for non-admin users
sitepoint.com
 – and the backend will enforce them on API routes as well.
Inviting Team Members: An org admin can invite new team members by email. The app will generate an invite link and send it via SendGrid email to the specified address. The invite email will contain a secure token or link for the recipient to accept the invitation, sign in (or sign up via Google OAuth), and join the organization. We need an “Invite User” flow in the UI (probably a modal or form where admin enters an email and selects a role). On the backend, we’ll create an invitation entry and email it out.
Organization Switching: If a user belongs to multiple orgs, the UI should allow switching context (for example, a dropdown to choose which organization’s data to view). Upon login, if the user has only one org, we default to that; if multiple, perhaps we prompt or have a default and allow switching. All data that is displayed or acted upon should be filtered by the current organization context. Data isolation between organizations is critical – a user in Org A must not access Org B’s data (enforced by queries including org_id filters).
Org CRUD: Users (or specifically, privileged users) should be able to create new organizations (e.g. “Create Organization” action if our business model allows one user to have multiple orgs). They should also be able to edit organization settings (name, logo, etc.) and remove members or delete the organization (with caution and appropriate confirmations).
2. User Authentication and Accounts
We will implement secure user authentication centered on Google Sign-In:
Google OAuth Login: Users will authenticate via Google. We’ll integrate with Google’s OAuth 2.0 using NextAuth.js for simplicity. When a user attempts to log in, they will be redirected to Google’s consent screen and on success, NextAuth will create a session for them. We need to set up a Google OAuth Client in the Google Developer Console (obtaining a Client ID and Secret) and configure callback URLs (Cloudflare Pages URL domain) for OAuth. NextAuth (Auth.js) will manage retrieving the user’s Google profile (name, email) and storing minimal info in a session.
User Database Records: Even though authentication is through Google, we will maintain a Users table in Postgres to store user-specific data (e.g., email, name, Google OAuth subject ID, role, subscription status, etc.). On first login via Google, we’ll create a user record if one doesn’t exist. This table also links to organization memberships (see above). We might use the email as a unique key.
Session Management: NextAuth will issue secure cookies for the session. We’ll likely use NextAuth’s JWT option (since we are on a serverless environment, JWT might be preferred over a database session). Security best practices (httpOnly cookies, appropriate cookie secure flags, etc.) must be followed. Cloudflare Pages being edge means each request will check the session JWT. NextAuth supports edge runtime; we have to ensure configuration is compatible with Cloudflare (e.g., use the edge provider if needed).
Optional Secondary Auth Methods: (If time permits or needed) We could allow email/password for those without Google accounts, but initially the requirement is explicitly Google Auth, so we will not complicate with other methods. All users must use Google sign-in, simplifying user onboarding.
Authorization: After login, the user can only access data from orgs they belong to. We will include the user’s org memberships in the session or fetch on data requests to validate tenant access. This, combined with the RBAC roles mentioned, secures the routes. We may also implement middleware in Next.js to protect API routes/pages, ensuring users are authenticated (redirect to login if not) and have the correct org context.
3. Real-Time Updates
One core requirement is to have real-time updates in the app, so that users see changes immediately without needing to refresh the page. This is crucial for collaborative or time-sensitive features. We will achieve this via a WebSockets or server push mechanism, since Next.js alone doesn’t automatically handle server-to-client push.
WebSocket Integration: Next.js (especially on serverless platforms) doesn’t natively support persistent WebSocket connections out-of-the-box
reddit.com
. Therefore, we plan to integrate a dedicated real-time service. Options include using a service like Pusher, Ably, or leveraging Supabase Realtime (if we use Supabase as our Postgres, it provides built-in realtime via WebSockets). We could also explore Cloudflare’s own Pub/Sub or Durable Objects for WebSocket support if available. The idea is to establish a WebSocket connection from the client to a pub/sub server so that when certain events occur (e.g., a new notification, or an update to a shared resource), the server can push that update to all relevant clients instantly.
Server-Sent Events (SSE): Alternatively, we might consider SSE for simpler use-cases of one-way updates, but SSE has some limitations and isn’t as interactive as WebSockets. Given the requirement for real-time collaboration-like updates, WebSockets are more suitable
reddit.com
.
Use Cases for Real-Time:
Notifications: If a user is online and a notification or message is generated (see Notifications section), they should see it appear in real-time (e.g., a bell icon indicator updates immediately).
Collaboration/Updates: Any domain-specific real-time feature (for example, if multiple users are editing data or one user performs an action that others need to see right away) will use this channel.
Status indicators: Possibly show when other team members are online or when certain background jobs complete, etc., through live updates.
Implementation Plan: We will set up an event broadcasting system. For instance, if using Supabase: we can use Supabase’s real-time listening on database changes (via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY under the hood) – then the client subscribes to changes on certain tables or channels, and gets updates in real time
makerkit.dev
. If using Pusher or a similar service, our Next.js backend would trigger Pusher events on relevant actions (like “new_notification” event), and clients subscribed to that event channel would receive the data. We will ensure the front-end is built to update the UI based on incoming WebSocket messages (using a state management solution or React context to store live data).
Performance & Scalability: We must be mindful of the number of concurrent connections. Cloudflare Pages might not maintain Node-style WebSocket server, so an external service (Pusher etc.) offloads that. If using Supabase, it can handle a reasonable number of socket connections for us. Real-time updates should be targeted to specific org rooms or user channels to avoid sending every update to every connected user.
By providing real-time capabilities, we keep users engaged and informed about important events as they happen
makerkit.dev
, improving the interactivity of the app.
4. Activity History (Audit Log)
We will include a History feature to track important actions or changes in the system. This serves as an audit log so that users (especially admins) can review past events and changes. Requirements for the history log:
What to Log: Key user actions and system events. For example, when a user creates or updates a record, when a team member is added or removed, when settings are changed, or subscription status changes – these can generate history entries. We should define which events are relevant to record. Likely, any create/update/delete of core entities in the app would be logged (with who did it and when). Also login/logout events, invitation sent/accepted, etc., might be logged for security/audit purposes.
History Records: In the database, we’ll have a History (or AuditLog) table. Fields might include: an auto ID, timestamp, actor (user who performed the action, or system), action type (e.g. “Created Project”, “Updated Profile”, “Invited User”), entity reference (maybe a generic reference ID or description of what was affected), and possibly a JSON blob of additional details (to record things like previous values/new values if needed). This table is keyed by organization as well, so each org’s history is separate.
Viewing History: There will be a page or section in the UI (likely for admins) called “History” or “Activity Log”. It will display a chronological list of events (with newest first). For readability, we can format entries in sentences, e.g., “Mar 5, 2025 14:32 – John Doe added a new Client record ‘Acme Corp’” or “Mar 5, 2025 14:35 – Jane Smith updated the deal value from $500 to $600”. We may group by date with headings for each day. Providing search or filters (e.g. filter by user or action type) would be a bonus but not mandatory for MVP.
Technical Implementation: Each time an important action occurs in the code, we will create a record in the History table. This could be done within our API route logic or via database triggers. For flexibility, doing it in application code is fine: e.g., after successfully handling an “invite user” request, insert a history row “Invited user X to organization”. If many different actions to log, one approach is to have a small logging utility function to call with parameters (user, org, action type, metadata) to insert the record.
Retention and Privacy: History logs can become large; we should consider how many to keep. Possibly we keep all, or we might later implement pruning or archiving of logs older than a certain date. Since this is internal to each org, we’ll assume we keep them indefinitely for now. We must ensure only org members (or only admins) can view their org’s history. The data is sensitive (it could show user emails, etc.), so proper access control to this page is needed.
Use Cases: This feature allows transparency – team members can know “who did what” if something changed. It’s useful for troubleshooting (e.g., “why is this data missing? – check history and see if someone deleted it”). It can also satisfy audit requirements if the product needs compliance (for example, in finance or enterprise contexts).
5. Notifications System
The app will provide a Notifications feature to alert users of important events. This includes in-app notifications (a notification center or dropdown) and email notifications for certain events. Key requirements:
Notification Types: Define what events trigger a notification. For example: a user being invited to an org (they should get an email notification), assignment of a task or item to a user, or possibly system alerts like “Your subscription is about to expire” for admins. Also, if our app involves collaborative objects (e.g., comments or messages), those could generate notifications (“John commented on your post”, etc.). We will enumerate the primary notification types during development.
In-App Notification UI: We will have a notifications icon (typically a bell 🔔) in the app header. When there are unread notifications for the logged-in user, a badge counter is shown. Clicking it opens a panel or page listing notifications. Each notification entry shows a short description (e.g., “You have been added to Organization X by Jane Doe” or “Invoice INV-1001 is due in 3 days”) and maybe an icon or type indicator. Notifications can have a link or an action – for instance, clicking one might navigate the user to the relevant page (if applicable, e.g., opening the detail of whatever the notification is about).
Real-Time Updates: This ties into the real-time feature – when a new notification is created for a user, and if that user is online, the notification should appear in real-time. We’ll use the WebSocket channel to push notification events to the specific user. The client will listen and update the notification list immediately (perhaps using a context or state store for notifications). This way, notifications feel instantaneous.
Email Notifications: For certain notifications, especially those that are important or if the user is offline, we will send emails via SendGrid. Examples: invitation emails (as mentioned), passwordless login links if we do those, subscription payment receipts or warnings, etc. We should configure SendGrid templates for these or send simple text emails initially. We have to verify sender identity (likely use our app’s domain email like no-reply@ourapp.com via SendGrid domain authentication). Using SendGrid’s API, we’ll send emails in our backend functions. (SendGrid allows ~100 emails/day on free tier
medium.com
 which is fine for initial development/testing).
Notification Storage: In the database, we’ll have a Notifications table. Fields: id, userId (the recipient; or could be orgId plus maybe userId null if we allow org-wide notices), type, message, link (optional), isRead flag, createdAt timestamp, etc. Whenever an event triggers a notification, we create a row here. For instance, when a user is invited to org, create a notification for that user “You were invited to ...” and send email. If multiple users need to get notified of an event (e.g., a new project added and all org members should know), we would create a notification record for each relevant user. We’ll also mark notifications as read when the user views/dismisses them. Possibly allow users to dismiss or mark all as read for housekeeping.
User Preferences: Out of scope for MVP might be notification preference settings (like turning off certain emails), but we should keep the design extensible for that in the future. Initially, all critical events will be notified.
Benefits: This system keeps users engaged and informed. Real-time and email notifications ensure that time-sensitive information reaches users effectively, whether they are actively using the app or not
makerkit.dev
.
6. Subscription Management
The platform will likely be a subscription-based SaaS, so we need to handle user subscriptions for billing and feature access control. This includes free trial or tiered plans, payments, and restricting features based on subscription level. Requirements:
Subscription Plans: Define what plans are offered (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise). Each plan will have certain limits or features (for example, number of team members allowed, access to custom branding might be paid-tier only, etc.). We’ll outline the differences in a plans table or config.
Payment Integration: We will integrate with a payment processor, most likely Stripe, to handle subscription payments. Stripe is the industry standard for SaaS billing and supports recurring subscriptions easily. We will use Stripe’s subscription APIs: create Products and Prices in Stripe dashboard (e.g., “Pro Plan – $X per month”). In the app, an org admin can upgrade or manage their subscription. Upon choosing a plan, we redirect to a Stripe Checkout or use Stripe Elements to collect payment. After successful payment, Stripe will create a Subscription object on their end and we’ll get a webhook notification to update our database. Using Stripe’s Customer Portal can allow users to manage billing details and cancellations on their own if we integrate it
pedroalonso.net
.
Subscription Status Tracking: In our database, tie each organization (or the billing account – which could be the user or org, depending on model) to a subscription status. E.g., fields like plan, isActive, stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId, current period end, etc. When Stripe webhooks inform us of events (subscription created, renewed, failed, canceled), we update these fields. Only active/paid orgs should have access to paid features. If a subscription lapses, we may restrict functionality (soft lockout or read-only mode until payment).
Free Tier & Trials: Possibly allow a free tier with limited features, or a trial period for new signups. If implementing, we track trial expiration and notify users as it ends (another use of notifications/email).
UI for Subscription: Provide a “Billing” or “Subscription” page accessible to org admins. This page shows the current plan, usage (if applicable), next billing date, and an option to upgrade/downgrade or cancel. If using Stripe Customer Portal, we can simply provide a “Manage Subscription” button that links to the hosted portal. Otherwise, we’ll build forms to handle upgrades.
Recurring Revenue Handling: The system should aim for automated recurring billing. Subscriptions are a powerful way to generate recurring revenue and provide ongoing value to customers
pedroalonso.net
, so implementing them correctly is crucial. We rely on Stripe to manage the recurring charges and just respond to success/failure.
Access Control: Throughout the app, we’ll enforce limits based on subscription. For example, if the Free plan allows 3 team members and Pro allows 10, then in the “invite member” function we will prevent adding beyond the limit with a helpful message to upgrade. Similarly, features like Custom Branding might only be available on higher plans – the UI should indicate “This feature is available on Pro plan” if a free user tries. These conditions will be coded in a centralized config so it’s easy to adjust.
Subscription Cancellation: If a user cancels, we allow their plan to run until the end of the paid period (Stripe handles that by marking cancellation at period end). After that, we downgrade them (maybe to Free if that exists). Data related to a higher-tier feature should be preserved but perhaps read-only if they lose access. (For instance, if they had 5 team members but free only allows 3, we might lock invites until they are within limit, etc. We’ll define that logic to ensure a graceful downgrade path.)
Notifications & Emails: The system should notify org admins about billing issues or upcoming renewals. E.g., if a payment fails, send an email via Stripe or our system; if trial ending, send warning. This ties into SendGrid usage for automated emails related to subscriptions.
By integrating Stripe, much of the heavy lifting (secure payment handling, PCI compliance) is offloaded. Our focus will be on integrating Stripe Checkout and webhooks into the Next.js app. By the end of development, we should be able to create and manage subscription-based services in the Next.js application using Stripe smoothly
pedroalonso.net
.
7. Custom Branding (White-Label Features)
One major requirement is to allow custom branding for organizations, including custom URLs and logos. This will enable a white-label service where our customers (the orgs) can make the product look like their own.
Custom Logo and Theme: Each organization should be able to upload their logo (or choose an image URL) to use in the app’s UI. When a user from that org is logged in, the default app logo (and possibly primary color scheme) will be replaced with the org’s logo and brand colors. We will store the logo (likely in Cloudflare R2 or another storage, or simply in the database as a URL if small) and a color palette or theme settings per org. The UI will dynamically load those – e.g., in the layout, use the org’s logo image in the navbar. We must ensure that the component library we choose is themeable so we can apply custom brand colors easily (MUI supports theme overrides per tenant).
Custom Domain (URLs): Organizations may use their own domain to access the app. For instance, if our main app is at app.mysaas.com, Org ABC could use abc.theirdomain.com or dashboard.theirdomain.com as a CNAME to point to our app. Alternatively, we support subdomains of our domain, like abc.mysaas.com, for each org. We should accommodate both if possible
reddit.com
. The user story: Org admin goes to our settings and enters a domain they own (e.g., dashboard.acme.com). We then provide them some DNS instructions (set a CNAME to point to our Cloudflare Pages domain). Cloudflare Pages allows adding custom domains, so we will need to add that domain in our Cloudflare config (possibly via API or manually) to be an alias for our app. Once set up, when someone hits that custom domain, Cloudflare will serve our app. Our Next.js code will inspect the Host header of the request to determine which organization this corresponds to (we’ll maintain a mapping of custom domains to org IDs in the database). Then we load that org’s branding (logo, etc.) and data.
Dynamic Routing by Host: We’ll implement multi-tenancy such that one Next.js deployment serves all orgs. Using middleware or routing logic, we check the request URL. If it’s {org}.mysaas.com subdomain or a custom domain, we resolve which org it is. (If neither, default to maybe showing a marketing site or an error). Vercel has examples of multi-domain Next.js apps
reddit.com
 and Cloudflare should support this similarly. We should also handle the case of the main domain (mysaas.com) being used for our own marketing page vs app – likely, we will have a separate marketing site and use a subdomain like app.mysaas.com for the product. For PRD scope, assume the app is on a subdomain and orgs either use sub-subdomains or custom domains.
Branding in Emails: Custom branding extends to emails as well. When our system sends emails (invite, notification, etc.) on behalf of an organization, it should include that org’s name or logo in the content if applicable. (Full white-label might even use the org’s email/domain as sender, but that’s complex; more likely we just mention them in body and use a neutral sender name). This way, the end-users (org’s clients or members) see the communication as coming from the org, not just our company. We need to template our email content accordingly.
White-Label Frontend: Beyond logo and color, consider if the org can customize any other aspects. Perhaps a custom tagline or welcome message on the dashboard. We can start with logo & color scheme and expand later.
Access Control for Branding Settings: Only org admins can change branding settings (upload new logo, set domain). We’ll build a section in the Org Settings page for “Branding”. This page will have an upload field for logo and a field for custom domain. When a domain is entered, we should verify it (perhaps via a DNS TXT record or just trust that they will configure DNS). Cloudflare’s API might allow us to programmatically add that domain to our Pages project for SSL. If not, we will document a manual step for our ops.
Subdomain Option: For smaller customers who don’t have their own domain, we offer a subdomain option: e.g. orgname.mysaas.com as their dedicated URL
reddit.com
. We’ll automatically make those work (maybe wildcard DNS on our side). The org can choose a subdomain name upon creation (must be unique).
Benefit: Offering custom branding adds value for our enterprise customers – they can present the application as their own to their clients. It’s a typical white-label SaaS feature that can set us apart. We need to ensure the user experience is seamless: when someone accesses an org’s custom URL, they see the org’s logo and branding, and none of our base branding. Under the hood it’s the same app, just configured per tenant.
8. User Interface and UX Considerations
To deliver a polished product, we must pay attention to UI/UX across the application:
Responsive Design: The app should be fully responsive, working on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The chosen component library (MUI or others) generally ensures components are responsive, but we will design layouts that adapt (use flex, grid, and possibly custom CSS as needed). Test key pages on various screen sizes.
Consistency: By using a component library, we ensure consistent styling for buttons, forms, modals, etc. We will establish a theme (colors, typography) that aligns with a modern, clean aesthetic. Consistency in spacing, font sizes, and interaction feedback (hover states, active states) is important for a professional feel.
Navigation: The app will have a clear navigation scheme. Likely a top navigation bar or a side menu when logged in. It will include sections relevant to the user’s role: e.g., Dashboard, whatever main features, Notifications (icon), Account/Settings menu, and Org switcher. We should make it intuitive for a user to find settings (org settings vs personal settings) and to switch org context if applicable.
Performance (UX): Because we use SSR on Cloudflare’s edge, initial page loads will be very fast globally. We also leverage Next.js dynamic features to only load necessary code for each page (code-splitting). We should use loading indicators for any data fetch that isn’t instant, to keep the user informed. Real-time updates will reduce the need for manual refresh, improving perceived performance.
Accessibility: Ensure the UI is accessible (a11y). Our component library choice (MUI, Chakra) comes with accessible components (proper ARIA labels, focus management). We will still test things like keyboard navigation (tab order) and contrast ratios for readability.
Component Library Integration: We’ll customize the theme to match our brand (or at least a default brand for our own marketing). We will create re-usable components if any custom ones needed. The library covers most, but anything specific (like an org switcher dropdown or a custom chart) we might integrate other libs (e.g. chart library) with consistent styling.
Modern Look and Feel: The goal is a modern, polished interface. Material UI’s default look is clean, but we can further refine via theme. We’ll likely use a flat design with vibrant accent colors (configurable per org). Lots of whitespace and clean typography for a uncluttered interface. Any icons will use a consistent icon set (perhaps Material Icons or a custom set).
Internationalization (i18n): Not immediately requested, but we should keep it in mind if we need to support multiple languages in the future. Using standard libraries or keeping text in a messages file could help later. For now, English only is fine.
Testing UX: We should do user testing internally for workflows like sign-up, inviting a member, changing settings, to ensure they are smooth. Gather feedback and refine any confusing parts.
By leveraging a proven UI library and focusing on consistent design, we will deliver a UI that feels professional and modern from day one. As noted, MUI is trusted by industry leaders for building modern web apps
blog.croct.com
, which gives us confidence in this approach. The polished UI combined with our real-time, multi-tenant features will provide an excellent user experience.
Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: The architecture should handle potentially many organizations and users. Cloudflare’s edge hosting means we can scale globally without managing servers. The database (Postgres) should be a managed service (e.g., Neon, Supabase, or AWS RDS) to handle scaling; we’ll use connection pooling appropriately. Our multi-tenant design (org ID scoping) will allow the single application and database to serve all tenants. If needed, we partition heavy data by org to avoid one org’s usage affecting others. Real-time infrastructure (Pusher/Supabase) should be chosen to handle many concurrent connections.
Performance: With SSR on Cloudflare, latency will be low for users globally. We should optimize database queries with indices (especially on org_id and other filters). Use caching if appropriate for often-read data that doesn’t change frequently (Cloudflare cache or Next.js incremental static generation for public pages if any). However, most data is user-specific and real-time, so caching might be limited to assets or maybe public content. We should also optimize sends (e.g., sending emails asynchronously so as not to block user actions – possibly using a background queue or at least not making the user wait on the API call to finish email sending).
Security:
We will enforce authentication for all app pages (except maybe a marketing site or public landing pages). Data is always loaded per authenticated user’s org context. We will validate on each request (both client-side and server-side) that the session is valid.
Use HTTPS everywhere (Cloudflare will provide SSL for custom domains via its platform).
Sensitive data in the database (if any) should be encrypted or at least properly access-controlled.
We will implement proper input validation and use ORMs to prevent SQL injection, etc. Next.js helps prevent XSS by default escaping content, but we must still be careful if we render any user-generated HTML.
We should also protect against common vulnerabilities: e.g., rate-limit certain endpoints (like login or invite acceptance) to prevent abuse, and use CAPTCHA (Cloudflare Turnstile or similar) if bots are a concern on public forms.
Since we rely on Google for auth, we get a secure, battle-tested auth mechanism and MFA if the user has it on their Google account.
Maintainability: The codebase will be organized following Next.js conventions, making use of the App directory (if using Next 13) for clearer separation of UI and data fetching concerns. We will write clear documentation for the dev team on setting up the environment, deploying to Cloudflare, and any quirks (like needing to use the Neon driver for Postgres). Logging and error tracking should be included (maybe integrate Sentry or at least Cloudflare’s built-in logs) to catch runtime errors.
Compliance: If we store user personal data (names, emails), we should adhere to privacy laws (GDPR etc.) by allowing data export/delete if requested. Not a focus of initial dev, but keep data partitioned by user/org to help with that. For payments, using Stripe ensures PCI compliance is handled by Stripe.
Reliability: We should handle failures gracefully – e.g., if the database is down or a network call fails, show user a friendly error message and try to retry if appropriate. The system should have backups for the database (most managed Postgres have automated backups). For SendGrid/email failures, log them and allow retrying.
Real-Time and Consistency: Real-time features should degrade gracefully if the user’s connection is lost or if the service fails – e.g., if WebSocket disconnects, the app might show a “reconnecting…” indicator and eventually fallback to manual refresh. Data consistency between what’s shown in real-time and what’s in the database should be carefully managed (eventual consistency is fine, but our design should avoid cases like user seeing a notification and clicking it while the underlying data isn’t in DB yet – usually not an issue if we create DB record first then notify).
Conclusion
This PRD outlines a comprehensive set of features needed to build the SaaS application using Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Cloudflare Pages. In summary, we will deliver: a multi-tenant platform with organization-based data separation, real-time collaborative updates, Google-based authentication, email communication via SendGrid, subscription billing via Stripe, customizable branding per tenant, and a modern UI built on a robust component library. Each aspect has been researched and planned with appropriate technologies and best practices (as evidenced by external references and industry examples). With this document, the development team should have a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why each component is important. The next steps will be to translate these requirements into actionable tasks, design the system architecture in detail (especially for routing, database schema, and integrations), and begin implementation. With Cloudflare Pages and Next.js, we are leveraging cutting-edge platform capabilities – running our app at the edge for speed, while using cloud services (Postgres, SendGrid, Stripe) for backend functions – which sets us up for a highly performant and scalable application from the start. By adhering to these requirements and guidelines, we aim to build a secure, scalable, and user-friendly application that meets all the outlined needs and provides a solid foundation for future growth and enhancements.
