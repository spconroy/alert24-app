- Email notifications for monitoring check failures
- Organization member filtering based on roles and preferences
- Professional alert emails with service details
- Integration with the monitoring scheduler for real-time alerts

**Key Features:**

- **Role-based notifications** - Only admins, owners, and responders receive alerts
- **Email preference respect** - Honors user email notification settings
- **Rich alert content** - Includes service names, error details, and response times
- **Organization branding** - Uses organization logos and names in emails

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

- `lib/api-utils.js` - Standardized API utilities and error handling
- `lib/email-service.js` - Complete email service with SendGrid integration
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Existing Files Enhanced:

- `app/api/incidents/route.js` - Modernized with new error handling and notifications
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/invitations/route.js` - Added email sending functionality
- `app/api/monitoring/scheduler/route.js` - Added incident creation and email alerts
- `package.json` - Added SendGrid dependency

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling Architecture:

```javascript
// Before: Inconsistent error responses
return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Something went wrong' }, { status: 500 });

// After: Standardized with rich error details
return ApiResponse.error(new ApiError('Specific error message', 400), 400);
```

### Email Service Usage:

```javascript
// Professional invitation emails
await emailService.sendInvitationEmail({
  toEmail: email,
  organizationName: organization.name,
  inviterName: user.name,
  role,
  invitationLink,
  organizationBranding: { name: org.name, logoUrl: org.logo_url },
});
```

### Automatic Incident Management:

```javascript
// Smart incident creation with deduplication
const incident = await createIncidentForFailure(check, result);
if (incident) {
  await sendFailureNotifications(check, result);
}
```

## üé® Email Template Features

### Responsive Design:

- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Professional typography
- Modern color schemes
- Consistent branding

### Organization Branding:

- Custom logos in email headers
- Organization names in sender fields
- Branded color schemes
- White-label support

### Content Types:

- **Invitations** - Welcome new team members with role explanations
- **Incidents** - Critical alerts with severity badges and action buttons
- **Monitoring** - Service status changes with detailed metrics

## üöÄ Next Steps (Remaining TODOs)

1. **Complete Database Schema Fixes** - Add missing `auto_recovery` column to services table
2. **Escalation Policy Engine** - Build time-based escalation with notification rules
3. **Advanced Monitoring Features** - Add SSL certificate monitoring and keyword matching
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Implement caching and query optimizations

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Before:

- ‚ùå Inconsistent error handling across API endpoints

### 5. Monitoring & Service Association System (`app/api/monitoring/associate/route.js`)

**What was implemented:**

- Full API system for linking monitoring checks with status page services
- Automatic status page updates when monitoring checks fail or recover
- Professional React component for managing associations
- Intelligent status mapping based on failure types

**Key Features:**

- **Automatic Status Updates** - Service status reflects monitoring check results in real-time
- **Smart Status Mapping** - HTTP 5xx errors ‚Üí "down", 4xx errors ‚Üí "degraded", etc.
- **Association Management** - Easy UI for linking/unlinking checks and services
- **Dual Execution Support** - Works with both manual and scheduled monitoring checks
- **Professional UI** - Clean interface showing all associations and their status

**Files Updated:**

- ‚úÖ `app/api/monitoring/associate/route.js` - New API endpoint for managing associations
- ‚úÖ `app/api/monitoring/execute/route.js` - Added linked service status updates
- ‚úÖ `app/api/monitoring/scheduler/route.js` - Added linked service status updates
- ‚úÖ `components/MonitoringServiceAssociation.jsx` - New React component for UI

This comprehensive improvement brings Alert24 significantly closer to production readiness with enterprise-grade error handling, professional communications, automated incident management capabilities, and real-time status page synchronization.
