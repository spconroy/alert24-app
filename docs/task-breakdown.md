## Priority Changes for Adaptation

### Immediate Focus (First 2 weeks):
1. **Database schema transformation** - Add incident and monitoring tables
2. **Dashboard adaptation** - Transform existing dashboard for incident management
3. **Basic incident CRUD** - Core incident management functionality
4. **Simple monitoring** - HTTP/ping checks with existing status page integration

### Key Advantages of Adaptation:
- ✅ Authentication and user management already working
- ✅ Organization multi-tenancy already implemented
- ✅ Status page foundation already built
- ✅ Database connection and basic infrastructure ready
- ✅ Navigation and settings infrastructure in place

### Modified Success Metrics:
- Incident management functionality operational within 4 weeks
- Basic monitoring with auto-incident creation within 6 weeks
- Advanced alerting and escalation within 12 weeks
- Full incident management platform within 20 weeks (vs 24 weeks from scratch)

This adaptation approach allows us to build on the solid foundation already established while transforming the application into a comprehensive incident management platform.
