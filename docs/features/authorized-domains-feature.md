# Authorized Domains Feature

## Overview

The Authorized Domains feature allows organization administrators to whitelist email domains for automatic user enrollment. When users sign in with Google OAuth using an email from an authorized domain, they're automatically added to the organization with a predefined role, eliminating the need for manual invitations.

## Business Value

### **üè¢ Enterprise Onboarding**

- **Streamlined Team Access**: New employees can instantly access the organization
- **Reduced Admin Overhead**: No manual invitations or approval processes
- **Scalable Growth**: Supports organizations with frequent new hires
- **Professional Experience**: Immediate access builds confidence in the platform

### **üéØ Target Customers**

- **Enterprise Customers**: Companies with 50+ employees
- **Growing Teams**: Startups scaling rapidly
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools with standardized email domains
- **Consulting Firms**: Organizations with structured email domains

## How It Works

### **1. Domain Authorization**

Admins configure authorized domains in Settings:

```
Domain: company.com
Role: member (or admin)
Limit: 100 enrollments (optional)
```

### **2. Automatic Enrollment**

When `john@company.com` signs in with Google:

1. System checks if `company.com` is authorized
2. User is automatically added to the organization as `member`
3. Enrollment is logged for audit trail
4. User gets immediate access without waiting for approval

### **3. Security & Control**

- Only admins/owners can manage authorized domains
- Enrollment limits prevent abuse
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Domain validation prevents typos

## Database Schema

### **Core Tables**

#### `authorized_domains`

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- organization_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- domain (VARCHAR, e.g., "company.com")
- description (TEXT, optional notes)
- auto_role (VARCHAR, "member" or "admin")
- is_active (BOOLEAN)
- require_verification (BOOLEAN)
- max_auto_enrollments (INTEGER, nullable)
- current_enrollments (INTEGER)
- created_by (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
- last_used_at (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMPS)
```

#### `domain_enrollment_log`

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- authorized_domain_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- organization_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- email (VARCHAR)
- domain (VARCHAR)
- assigned_role (VARCHAR)
- enrollment_method (VARCHAR, "oauth_signin")
- ip_address (INET, optional)
- user_agent (TEXT, optional)
- status (VARCHAR, "enrolled"/"revoked"/"suspended")
- enrolled_at (TIMESTAMP)
- revoked_at, revoked_by, revoke_reason (for revocations)
```

### **Database Functions**

#### `check_authorized_domain(email_address TEXT)`

- Extracts domain from email
- Returns matching authorized domains with organization info
- Respects enrollment limits and active status

#### `enroll_user_via_domain(user_id, email, ip, user_agent)`

- Automatically enrolls user in organization
- Creates organization membership record
- Logs enrollment in audit table
- Updates enrollment counters
- Returns success/failure with details

#### `validate_domain_format(domain_name TEXT)`

- Validates domain format with regex
- Ensures proper length and structure
- Prevents invalid domains

## API Endpoints

```
GET /api/authorized-domains?organizationId=uuid
Authorization: Required (member+)
Response: { domains: [...], count: number }
```

### **Create Authorized Domain**

```
POST /api/authorized-domains
Authorization: Required (admin/owner only)
Body: {
  organizationId: uuid,
  domain: string,
  description?: string,
  autoRole: "member" | "admin",
  maxAutoEnrollments?: number,
  requireVerification?: boolean
}
```

### **Update Authorized Domain**

```
PUT /api/authorized-domains/{id}
Authorization: Required (admin/owner only)
Body: { ...same fields as create... }
```

### **Delete Authorized Domain**

```
DELETE /api/authorized-domains/{id}
Authorization: Required (admin/owner only)
Response: { message: "success" }
```
